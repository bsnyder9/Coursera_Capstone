    "**A description of the problem and a discussion of the background. (15 marks)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tampa, FL has a reputation of being a city where most citizens live in the surrounding suburbs and commute into the city for work. Because of this, the population isn't as dense as other cities, which can make it difficult for restaurant businesses to pick locations for new venues. I'd like to explore whether the existing venues (in a certain suburb?) can be modeled  based on their local area demographics to determine the best areas for a new venue to achieve a high number of \"likes\" or a high rating on Foursquare.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to predict this information would help hedge against the usual risks that any small business faces when starting up. Sustaining a business with effective management is also important, but in order to even reach that point, a prospective founder needs to choose a location and actually open their venue. Mobile businesses such as food trucks are an alternative to making a solid decision about a specific location, but if that isn't a viable option, then it would be important to be well-informed about the potential customer base near any potential locations - otherwise, a struggling business may have to choose between relocating or closing shop altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most restaurants tend to be more popular with certain demographics than others. Market research may be required to identify what those target demographics actually are, and even if a businessperson thinks they know best, it wouldn't take much time or effort to employ some data science to convert publically-available information about local demographics and consumer sentiment about comparable venues into actionable insight on areas that are prime for a new venue.\n",

    "1. Get lat/long for center of Brandon, FL (suburb of Tampa)\n",
    "2. Get venues within 7500 meter radius of center of Brandon, FL (town boundaries identified earlier as roughly 15km x 15km)\n",
    "    + Filter by category to restaurants (section = \"food\")\n",
    "    + Take list of venueIDs and iterate thru to call for venue details of each, specifically seeking number of \"likes\" and the rating\n",
    "    + Store this data to avoid repeating this call (it'll eat thru the allotment quickly)\n",
    "3. Import shapefiles and get lat/long for center of each census tract\n",
    "    + Find distance of each to center of Brandon, FL; filter to census tracts within 15 mile radius\n",
    "4. Import census tract demographic data from CSVs\n",
    "    + Import per-race CSVs into individual dataframes; from 4th column on, only need every other column (estimates only, no need for margin of error; column headers are confusing bc they include an extra headers, causing them to be misaligned)\n",
    "    + Append them into a single master dataframe with an additional column to identify which racial dataframe the rows came from\n",
    "    + Pivot to reduce data to 1 row per census tract (4247 rows for FL); with age/sex/race and age/sex subpopulation columns (23x2x9 + 23x2x1 = 460 columns)\n",
    "    + Add additional subpopulation columns aggregating by age/race, age, and race (23x10 + 23 + 2 = 255 more columns)\n",
    "    + Filter to relevant census tracts\n",
    "5. Calculate distance from each venue to each census tract, then calculate proximity of subpopulations as the weighted average value for each demographic subpopulation based on the distances of the census tracts from the venue times the proportion of the subpopulation in that tract vs all the tracts, divided by the number of census tracts (\"how far away from the venue is this subpopulation?\")\n",
    "7. Dataframe to be analyzed: row per venue; columns for category, lat, long, likes, rating, and proximity of each subpopulation\n",
    "8. Use machine learning algorithms such as regression and decision tree to develop model for predicting the number of likes and the rating of a venue based on category and subpopulation promixities\n",
    "9. Identify \"untapped markets\" of census tracts where a restaurant could do well by mapping census tracts w/ their predicted number of likes and rating, along with the number of existing venues in that census tract"
